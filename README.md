# NewsApp
## Eight project in ABND course

The goal was to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. My own choise was what type of information to show and what topics to choose.

## Project overview
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you worked to build the Earthquake app. Along the way, you learned about connecting to the internet in Android, parsing responses from an API, updating the information in your app, and properly displaying that information. Practicing these skills is imperative in order to build apps that delight and surprise users by anticipating their needs and supplying them with relevant information.

## Project requirement
- Connecting to an API
- Parsing the response of the API
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Updating information regularly
- Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
- Using https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/
